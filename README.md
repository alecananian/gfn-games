For whatever reason, NVIDIA doesn't want to list out all the GeForce Now-compatible games on one page, making you instead [use a search field](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/games/) to filter their static list of games.

This repository is the code for a simple web page that lists out all the compatible games:
**[List of NVIDIA GeForce Now Games](https://alecananian.github.io/gfn-games/)**
